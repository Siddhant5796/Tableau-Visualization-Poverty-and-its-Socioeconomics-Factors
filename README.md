# Tableau Visualization: Poverty and the Socioeconomics Factors

In the current analysis, I created interactive visualization using Tableau to measure the association between poverty and its key socioeconomic dimensions and analyze the implications of the significance of the key contributors including education, unemployment rate, and net income on the overall growth of a nation. 

My findings from visualizing the data are as follows: 
- According to UNESCO, if all adults completed secondary education, we could cut down global poverty rate by more than half. 
- GDP per capita was an important factor that resulted in high poverty reduction. 
- Higher out-of-pocket health expenditure led to increased poverty, at the same time government health expenditure has no significant impact on poverty.
- Foreign Direct Investment is beneficial more to High-Income Economies. 
- Unemployment rate is positively related to the Poverty levels in an economy.
- As per UNESCO Lack of Equal opportunities Based on Race, Ethnicity and Gender is major cause of Unemployment in low-income countries.
